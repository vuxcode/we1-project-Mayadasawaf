The project is a page for Syrian recipes.
 It consists of three sections: the main course section, the salad section, and the soup section. Each section has nine recipes,
 with three recipes per section including a photo, ingredients, and preparation method. 
 The ingredients are usually enough for four people. Users can contact the website administrator and send any inquiries they want. 
 The page is written in English.





# Project Notes

The project took more than thirty hours to execute due to multiple modifications that were made to match 
the original picture which I sent by the teacher at the beginning.
Many difficulties were faced concerning the characteristics of each component of the page. 
Initially, I searched for suitable pictures that I modified using Paint and then
searched for recipes, which took time to be translated from Arabic to English.
The page's  titled is in Swedish, although the entire content is in English. 
I divided the project time into five hours for pictures and research 
and the rest for modifications and properties.
Every time I write new code, new problems arise, either from writing the code wrong,
 a specific attribute conflicting with others, or rewriting an attribute multiple times.
