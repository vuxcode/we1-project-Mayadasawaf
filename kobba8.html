   <p> There are different doughs you can make kubbe from but in this case I have used bulgur and my recipe follows here.
    <br>

    Cube dough on bulgur (approx. 4 people):<br>
    <li>5 dl bulgur (fine-grained)</li>
    <li>2.5 dl semolina</li>
    <li>salt and pepper</li>
    <li>5 dl hot water</li>
    
  <br>  How to use:<br>
    
  <li> 1- Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl and stir. Pour in the hot water and stir further. Let stand and infuse for about 15 minutes.</li>
   <li>2-Then mix everything (hand mixer works well) and add a stream of more hot water (if needed) until a durable dough is formed. Knead the dough for a while with moistened hands.</li></p>
   <p> Cubes can be shaped in different ways. If you want to make a saucer, take an egg-sized piece and flatten it in the palm of your hand, and the thinner the walls, the better the rubber. Add the filling and then fold over the edges of the dough and pinch together. Using the palms of your hands, shape into a saucer.</p>

  
 
   <p>The filling:<br>
    300 grams of minced meat
    <li>1 finely chopped onion</li>
    <li>1 dl parsley</li>
   <li> 4 tablespoons of pine nuts (coarsely chopped almonds also work well)</li>
   <li> 1 tablespoon of seven spices (can be omitted or replaced with allspice)</li>
    <li>0.5 teaspoons of cinnamon</li>
    <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li></p>
    <p>How to use: 

       <li> Fry minced meat and onion in a little oil for about 10 minutes. Add the spices and let fry until the minced meat is ready.</li>
       <li> Toast the pine nuts in a dry frying pan and then mix the pine nuts and chopped parsley with the minced meat mixture. Mix well and remove from the plate and let cool.</li>
        <li>When you have all the parts ready, it's time to start rolling into copper and then deep-frying in a frying pan on a fairly high heat. Turn the cube so it turns golden brown all around.</li></p>
